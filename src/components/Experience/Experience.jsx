              I designed creative pieces for corporate email, web, and UX/UI by
              implementing client requests, common trends, and analyzing
              performances to generate over $300M in annual revenue.
              Additionally, I developed and encoded digital assets and emails
              for marketing campaigns, resulting in a 20% increase in
              click-through rates. I also coordinated video projects and aided
              in post-production, ensuring 100% on-time delivery of all
              projects.

              revitalizing digital wireframes for marketing campaigns resulted
              in an impressive 30% surge in website traffic. In addition, I
              provided supervision and guidance to marketing coordinators,
              creating a collaborative and productive work environment that
              maintained a perfect record of 100% timely execution for all

              I suggested original design and strategic branding ideas by
              utilizing quantitative analytic portals and conducting
              observational analyses of digital marketing tactics, resulting in
              a remarkable 40% increase in brand recognition. Additionally, I
              successfully cultivated targeted audiences for marketing

              brand guidelines, which led to an impressive 70% surge in customer
              engagement. Moreover, I skillfully crafted on-brand descriptions,
              blogs, and newsletters for various brands. This involved employing
              keyword planners to ensure the verbiage was effective for both
              user engagement and organic SEO, ultimately resulting in a
              substantial 60% increase in organic search traffic.
